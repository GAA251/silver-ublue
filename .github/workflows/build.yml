          # Uses rpm-ostree's build-chunked-oci feature to rechunk the image, allowing for smaller images and smaller updates.
          # This increases the build-time and take up more space during build-time.

          # TEMP!!!
          # Keeps failing after minor changes due to rpm-ostree bug
          # This needs to be merged in order to be fixed:

          maximize_build_space: true # we enable this because chunked_oci takes up more space and build time.
